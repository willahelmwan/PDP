Class.java - Interface for Class

    - this would be the equivalent of the provides in DrRacket, but only for 
      class methods
  
    - we are not allowed to change the interface files for this project

Class(1).java - Class definition for object and data functions, and it will
                implement the interface defined in the Class.java file. Java
				requires these to be in separate files. You cannot use the 
				same name for the interface as the class. Ex You can't define
				the UTC class, if the interface is already called UTC.

    - This defines how the data is structured for the object
    - This holds the method definitions for the interface, any public method 
	  here has to be in the Class.java (interface)
  
    * We are not allowed to edit the interface files (UTC.java, Flight.java, 
      RacketList.java) so we cannot define any public methods in Class(1).java
      beyond what is listed in those files.

Class(s).java - Class Factory

    - The factory will contain a function called make() which will create an 
	  object of the class type. 
  
    - It was stated in the problem set we may add other functions if we so 
	  desire to these files. If they were to swap out these files after letting 
	  us create custom functions, they would not be able to test our program. 
 
Class(H).java - Class Helper

    - This is where we will put our helper functions instead, just incase they
      decide to replace our factory next week.

	  
Compile Program

javac *.java in directory with files


Run Program (benchmarks)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
java benchmarks - runs some tests and benchmarks on the different functions
