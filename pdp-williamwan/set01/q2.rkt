;; Exercise 14. Define the function string-last, which extracts the last 1String from a non-empty string. Donâ€™t worry about empty strings.
;; Goal: accepts a non-empty string and extracts the last 1String.

;; DATA DEFINITION: none.

;; string-last: NonEmptyStr -> 1String
;; GIVEN: a non-empty string
;; RETURNS: the last 1String
;; EXAMPLES:
;; (string-last "hello") = "o"
;; (string-last "hi ") = " "
;; (string-last "hello hi \t") = "\t"
;; (string-last " ") = " "
;; STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
