;; Still reading textbook and trying to figure out this problem. 

;; DATA DEFINITION: none.

;; cvolume: NonNegReal -> NonNegReal
;; GIVEN: the length of a side of an equilateral cube
;; RETURNS: the volume of the cube
;; EXAMPLES:
;; (cvolume 0.1) = 0.001
;; (cvolume 2) = 8
;; (cvolume 0) = 0
;; STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
